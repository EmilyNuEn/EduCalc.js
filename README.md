A set of simulations to assist the teaching of calculus

Users/Instructors:
Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to use/adapt for your classroom. All I ask is that you give credit where credit is due. To download executables, go to the dist folder and download.

If you have any suggestions for improvements or new simulations that you would find helpful, please leave a report in the issues tab with a tag relating to that particular simulation or the "New Simulation" tag

Enjoy!
